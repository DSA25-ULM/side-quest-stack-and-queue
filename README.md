# 🧙‍♂️ Side Quest: Stack & Queue Trials

Welcome, Challenger! 🗡️  
You've trained hard in the lands of variables, loops, and functions...  
But now, a new **side quest** awaits you — one that will test your mind with the **ancient structures of Stack and Queue**.

You’ve been summoned to complete a series of trials. Each trial is designed to test your skill with fundamental data structures used by the most seasoned programmers in the realm.

Prove yourself, and rise as a true knight of logic and code. ⚔️

## 🧱 Stack Trials

### Trial 1: Evaluate Postfix Expression 🧮  

**Objective:** Evaluate a postfix (Reverse Polish) expression using a stack.  
**Example:**  
Input: `["2", "3", "1", "*", "+", "9", "-"]`  
Output: `-4`

---

### Trial 2: Valid Parentheses 🧷  

**Objective:** Check if a string containing `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'` is properly nested and matched.  
**Example:**  
Input: `"({[]})"`  
Output: `true`

---

### Trial 3: Next Greater Element 🔮  

**Objective:** For each element in the array, find the next element to the right that is greater. Return `-1` if none.  
**Example:**  
Input: `[2, 1, 2, 4, 3]`  
Output: `[4, 2, 4, -1, -1]`

## 🧺 Queue Trials

### Trial 4: Queue Simulation 🏰  

**Objective:** Simulate a queue where the person give some query.
**Example** 
Input: 
`6`
`add 1 1`
`add 2 2`
`add 3 3`
`del 2`
`rev`
`del 2`
Output: 
`1`
`3`
`6`
`1`
`3`
